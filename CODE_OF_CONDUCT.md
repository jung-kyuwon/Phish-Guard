# PhishGuard GitHub Community Standards

The PhishGuard project aims to develop an intelligent solution for detecting and preventing voice phishing. To ensure the success of this project, we strive to maintain an environment on GitHub where members can freely exchange ideas based on mutual respect and collaboration. To this end, we have established the following community standards to encourage respectful interactions, understanding of project goals, and constructive feedback among community members.

### 1. Mutual Respect and Inclusivity
Embracing Diverse Opinions: The PhishGuard community includes people from diverse backgrounds. We welcome contributors of all levels, from newcomers to experienced developers, and encourage a respectful attitude toward everyone’s ideas.
Constructive Criticism and Feedback: Criticism should focus on ideas rather than individuals. Please provide constructive and polite feedback, and if conflicts arise, take a step back or use GitHub’s moderation tools to resolve issues.
### 2. Fostering a Safe and Productive Community
Creating a Safe Environment: PhishGuard seeks to raise awareness about voice phishing and help users stay safe from this threat. If there is any content that feels uncomfortable or inappropriate within the community, you are encouraged to report it to the GitHub support team.
Maintaining Respectful Discussions: Project-related discussions should remain relevant to the topic at hand and avoid unnecessary conflicts or policy violations. If a discussion becomes problematic, administrators may lock the conversation.
### 3. Managing Content and Interactions
Contribution Guidelines: To help contributors understand the ways to participate in the project, we provide a CONTRIBUTING file, which outlines the project’s goals and guidelines for contribution.
Comment Management: Users with write access to the repository may edit, delete, or hide comments, with all comment edits visible to other users. This helps maintain the quality of the project.
### 4. Conflict Resolution
Blocking Users: To prevent unnecessary conflict, you have the option to block users if you do not wish to interact with them.
Interaction Limits: If the project experiences spam or malicious interactions, temporary interaction limits may be set to maintain the project’s stability.
### 5. Actions for Policy Violations
GitHub may take actions such as content deletion, hiding user accounts, or account suspension in response to violations of community policies. These measures help PhishGuard operate within GitHub’s safe and collaborative platform.

By setting these community standards, we aim to manage PhishGuard as a safe and productive space for collaboration, supporting our goal of preventing voice phishing effectively.
